1.
  (a): Roses are not red, violets are not blue.
  (b): The bus is not late and my watch is not slow.
  (c): If a number is not prime then it is not odd and it is not 2.
  (d): If a number x is not a prime, then √x is a rational number.

2.
 (a)
  1.A and ~B or ~C
  2.A and B or ~A and ~C
  3.A or B or C or ~A and ~B and ~C
  4.A or B or C

 (b)
(1)  A  B  C   ~B or ~C   ~C   A and C
     1  1  1       0       0      1
     1  1  0       1       1      0
     1  0  1       1       0      1
     1  0  0       1       1      0
     0


     So A is true, B is false and C is true. Or A is true, B is true and C is false.

(2)   A B   ~A->~B  ~B->~A
      1 1     1       1
      1 0     1       0  
      0 1     0       1
      0 0     0       1
     So the answer is that both A and B are telling truth or A is telling the truth and B is lying. Or A is telling the truth, B is lying.


(3)    A  B  C   ~B->~C  ~C->~A  ~A->~B
       1  1  1     1       1       1
       1  1  0     1       0       1
       1  0  1     0       1       1
       1  0  0     1       0       1
       0  1  1     1       1       0
       0  1  0     1       1       0
       0  0  1     0       1       1      
       0  0  0     1       1       1
      So everyone is telling the truth.

 3. (a).∼ ((p∨ ∼ q) ∧ r)=(~ (pv ~ q) V r )=(~p ∧ q) V ~r

    (b). ~((p∧q) U r) U (r U s)=0
     r U s is 0. Both r and s is 0.
     (p ∧ q) U r is 0.
     p  ∧  q is 0. p and q can be both 0, or one 1 one 0

4. （a)
        (1)Yes. Because 6 can be divided into 2*3, if n can be divisible by 6, it must can be divided by 3.
        (2)No. Because if n can be divides by 9, it is odd. But it should be even obviously.
        (3)No. n is even not a rational number
        (4)No. 12 can be divided into 2*6. If n can be divisble by 6, it may not be able to be divisble by 2 again
        (5)Yes. The condition is to say it is even and it can be divisble by 3, obviously it can be divisble by 6.

    (b)
        (1)No. Maybe n is odd and it should be even.
        (2)No. Same as above.
        (3)No. It is not a rational number
        (4)Yes. 12 can be divided into 2*6
        (5)Yes. This condition is equal to 6 | n

  5.
    (a)  ~p->q
    (b)  ~(p -> ~q)
    (c)  (p->q) ∧ (q->p)= ~((~p->~q) U (~q->~p))
