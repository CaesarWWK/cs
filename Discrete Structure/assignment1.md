  (a): Roses are red, violets are not blue.
  (b): The bus is not late and my watch is not slow.
  (c): If a number is not prime then it is not odd and it is not 2.
  (d): If a number x is not a prime, then √x is a rational number.

 (a)
  1.A and ~B or ~C
  2.A and B or ~A and ~C
  3.A or B or C or ~A and ~B and ~C
  4.A or B or C

 (b)
  1.If A is true, B is lying, so C is telling the truth. So what C say is true, which means A is true and C is true. If A said that maybe
  C is lying, so that A and C are lying, that wont be true.    So A is true  B is lying C is true.

    If A is lying, B and C are telling the truth, C is telling the truth, but we can find that A is lying, so this presume is not true.

  2.If B is lying, the same as A. So A should be saying the truth. But if B is lying, A should also be lying, so it cant be B is lying.

    If B is telling the truth, the same as A. So A should be saying the truth. In fact, because B is saying the truth, as well as A, both them are telling the truth . Correct

  3.If B is telling the truth, C and A maybe both lying . If C is telling the truth, B and A should have the same truth value, which means A and B and C can be all telling the truth. Correct. If C is lying, and A is lying, C must be telling the truth. Wrong.

    If B is lying, C lying equal s A telling the truth.If C is lying, A lying equals B telling the truth. So if A telling the truth, B and C are all lying, Correct. If A is lying, C should be telling the truth, false. If C is telling the truth, both A and B are lying. Correct.

 3. (a).∼ ((p∨ ∼ q) ∧ r)=(~ (pv ~ q) V r )=(~p ∧ q) V ~r

4. （a)
        (1)Yes. Because 6 can be divided into 2*3, if n can be divisible by 6, it must can be divided by 3.
        (2)No. Because if n can be divides by 9, it is odd. But it should be even obviously.
        (3)No. n is even not a rational number
        (4)No. 12 can be divided into 2*6. If n can be divisble by 6, it may not be able to be divisble by 2 again
        (5)Yes. The condition is to say it is even and it can be divisble by 3, obviously it can be divisble by 6.

    (b)
        (1)No. Maybe n is odd and it should be even.
        (2)No. Same as above.
        (3)No. It is not a rational number
        (4)Yes. 12 can be divided into 2*6
        (5)Yes. This condition is equal to 6 | n
