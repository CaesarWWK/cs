a):
   Inode is a kind of file which saves where the files are on the speicific 
   location of disks. Every inode links to many files and this kind of link 
   is called hard link. Another kind of link which links an inode to another
   inode is called soft link.

b):If we lose file1, file3 wont be removed,because file3 has a hard link 
  with file1, which means it saves all the content of file1.

   However, if we delete file2, file4 will also be removed. Because the
   link between them is soft link, which only links them only by path.
