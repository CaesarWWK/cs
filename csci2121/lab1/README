CSCI 2121 Lab 1: Bit Slinging
Directions to Students

Your goal is to modify your copy of lab1.c so that it passes all the
tests in the compiled lab1 binary  without violating any of the coding guidelines.

***********************************************************
1. Modifying lab1.c
***********************************************************

Carefully read the instructions in the lab1.c file before you
start. These give the coding rules that you will need to follow if you
want full credit.

*************************************
2. Testing for correctness
*************************************

The Makefile in this directory compiles your version of lab1.c with
additional code to create a program (or test harness) named conviniently lab1.

Give the command:

	unix> make

to compile the code.

Run the program with the command:

	unix> ./lab1 [optional command line arguments]

When moving from one platform to another, you want to get rid of the
old version of the compiled lab1 and generate a new one.  Use the commands:

	unix> make clean
	unix> make

*******************
3. What the compiled program does
*******************

running your compiled lab1.c using ./lab1 tests your procedures for correctness by running a number of test
cases.  It does not guarantee exhaustive evaluation.  In addition, it does
not check your code for compliance with the coding guidelines.  The makefile does that.

If you think the tests are wrong send mail
to the lead person for this assignment.

Here are the command line options for the compiled lab1:
   -f Name  Check only the named function
   -h       Print the list of options
